Financial Insights Pipeline

Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing financial data using Azure services, Databricks, and GitHub. The pipeline fetches financial stock data from the Alpha Vantage API, stores it in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), processes it in Databricks, and visualizes the insights in tools like Power BI.

Features

Data Fetching: Retrieves daily stock data from the Alpha Vantage API.
Data Lake Integration: Stores raw and processed data in ADLS.
Data Transformation: Processes data using PySpark in Databricks.
Pipeline Automation: Automates data movement using Azure Data Factory (ADF).
Visualization: Creates actionable insights for financial trends.

Technologies Used
Azure Services:
Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2)
Azure Data Factory (ADF)
Azure Blob Storage
Databricks:
PySpark
Delta Lake

Alpha Vantage API:
Financial data retrieval

GitHub:
Code versioning and project documentation

Project Workflow
Fetch Data:
Use the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve financial data.

Store Raw Data:
Upload the raw CSV file to the ADLS raw folder.

Automate Data Ingestion:
Use ADF to automate the movement of raw data to Databricks.

Transform Data:
Process the data in Databricks:
Clean data
Calculate daily changes, moving averages, and trends.

Store Processed Data:
Save processed data in the ADLS processed folder.
Optionally, export to MySQL for querying or reporting.

How to Set Up
1. Prerequisites
Azure Subscription (Student trial or paid)
